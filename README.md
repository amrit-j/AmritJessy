## Best Programming Practices...


###	• validate input before processing 
      Ensure that inputs are correct and working before running the script/program, or moving on to another section.
###	• a clear and uncluttered mainline  
      Ensure that your work is understandable to another programmer and uses efficient programming practices. Ensure that          the main function/module of the code is laid out in a way that it can be changed easily, without breaking other             things. Also should include comments, to ensure other programmers know what a certain process is achieving,
###	• one logical task per subroutine  
      Ensure all functions and modules are limited to one specific task, to ensure that it is efficient, and clear to read,
      so things don't get bundled up, and processes don't rely one one another to function, and tasks can be removed when         needed.
###	• use of stubs
      Use stubs for dev phases, and ensure they are appropriately labelled and marked, to ensure their removal, when not
      required for functionality at the end stages of the dev phase.
### • appropriate use of control structures and data structures
      
###	• writing for subsequent maintenance

###	• version control  
      Ensure 
###	• regular backup  
###	• exception handling 
###	• functions are able to return a single data structure or value
